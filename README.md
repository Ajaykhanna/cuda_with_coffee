# CUDA with Coffee

#### Welcome to CUDA with Coffee repository. 
This repository contains example programs written in C++/CUDA and Python/Numba(CUDA) programming language. The examples demonstrate general purpose programming tasks utilizing CUDA enabled GPUs. The repository includes examples of:  
* **Vector addition (raw)**: This examples shows how to use C++/CUDA and python/Numba(CUDA) to perform mathematical operations on arrays. The code demonstrates how to create two arrays, add them together, and store the result in a third array. The code also includes comments to help explain each step
* **Vector addition with Unified Memory & Vector addition with Perfecting**: Shows, in C++/CUDA, how to avoid writing and copying to and from the gpu device by using "cudaMallocManaged" and one way to speedup calculations using "cudaMemPrefetchAsync".
* **Matrix multiplication**: This example shows how to use C++/CUDA and Python/Numba(CUDA) to perform matrix operations. The code demonstrates how to create two matrices, multiply them together, and store the result in a third matrix. 

** More examples on the way **
